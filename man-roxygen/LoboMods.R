#' Modified so that absences are treated appropriately:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{Character 7 }{inapplicable to absent where cephalic shield (char 3) is absent}
#'    \item{Character 40}{inapplicable to absent where paired appendages absent}
#'    \item{Character 46}{inapplicable to absent}
#'    \item{Character 64}{76: stet; trunk annulations / limbs may primitively have been papillate or non-papillate}
#'    \item{Character 69}{a good case that the fusion of flaps with endopods is secondary; thus inapplicable to absent where 67 is applicable}
#'    \item{Character 72}{inapplicable to absent where appendages are present}
#'    \item{Character 77}{inapplicable to absent where papillae applicable, as spine is a secondary elaboration of papillae}
#'    \item{Character 78}{inapplicable to absent}
#'    \item{Character 79}{stet, as possible that limbs evolved by extension of plate-like exoskeletal element }
#'    \item{Character 80}{inapplicable to absent, on assumption that ancestral claws were simple }
#'    \item{Characters 83, 84, 86, 87, 92}{inapplicable to absent; an obvious elaboration }
#'    \item{Character 93}{inapplicable to absent; ancestrally undifferentiated by definition? }
#'    \item{Character 96}{inapplicable to absent; ancestrally undifferentiated by definition. Ambiguous in taxa that lack claws as rotation would not be observed. ]}
