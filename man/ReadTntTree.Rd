\usage{
ReadTntTree(filename, relativePath = NULL, keepEnd = 1L,
  tipLabels = NULL)

TNTText2Tree(treeText)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{character string specifying path to TNT \code{.tre} file.}

\item{relativePath}{(optional) character string specifying location of the
matrix file used to generate the TNT results, relative to the current working
directory, for portability.  Taxon names will be read from this file if they
are not specified by \code{tipLabels}.}

\item{keepEnd}{(optional, default 1) integer specifying how many elements of the file
path to conserve when creating relative path (see examples).}

\item{tipLabels}{(optional) character vector specifying the names of the
taxa, in the sequence that they appear in the TNT file.  If not specified,
taxon names will be loaded from the data file linked in the first line of the
\code{.tre} file specified in \code{filename}.}

\item{treeText}{Character string describing a tree, in the parenthetical
format output by TNT.}
}
\value{
a tree of class \code{phylo}.
}
\description{
Reads a tree from TNT's paranthetical output.
}
\details{
Supports trees that have been written from TNT in parenthetical notation
using \code{tsav*}.  If taxa have been saved using their names (\code{taxname=}),
then the tip labels will be read directly from the TNT \code{.tre} file.  If
taxa have been saved using their numbers (\code{taxname-}), tip labels will be
imported from the linked matrix file that is listed in the first line of the
\code{.tre} file.  Ensure that this file exists in the expected location -- if
it does not, use the \code{relativePath} argument to override this default, or
specify \code{tipLabels} to set manually.

\examples{
{
  \dontrun{
  # TNT read a matrix from c:/myproject/tnt/coding1/dataset.nex
  # The results of an analysis were written to c:/myproject/tnt/output/results1.tnt
  # results1.tnt will contain a hard-coded reference to
  # "c:/myproject/tnt/coding1/dataset.nex"

  getwd() # Gives the current working directory

  # Say that working directory is c:/myproject, which perhaps corresponds to a
  # Git repository.
  # This directory may be saved into another location by collaborators, or on a
  # different filesystem by a continuous integration platform.

  # Works on local machine but not elsewhere:
  ReadTntTree('tnt/output/results1.tnt')

  # Takes only the filename from the results
  ReadTntTree('tnt/output.results1.tnt', 'tnt/coding1')

  # Uses the last three elements of c:/myproject/tnt/coding1/dataset.nex
  #                                               3     2       1
  # '.' means "relative to the current directory", which is c:/myproject
  ReadTntTree('tnt/output/results1.tnt', '.', 3)

  # If the current working directory was c:/myproject/rscripts/testing,
  # you could navigate up the directory path with '..':
  ReadTntTree('../../tnt/output/results1.tnt', '../..', 3)
