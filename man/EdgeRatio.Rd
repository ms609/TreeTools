\title{Ratio of external:internal edge length}
\usage{
EdgeRatio(x)

\method{EdgeRatio}{phylo}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tree of class \code{\link[ape:read.tree]{phylo}}.}
}
\value{
\code{EdgeRatio()} returns a numeric specifying the ratio of external
to internal edge length (> 1 means the length of a tree is predominantly
in external edges), with attributes \code{external}, \code{internal}, and \code{total}
specifying the total length associated with edges of that nature.
}
\description{
Reports the ratio of tree length associated with external edges (i.e.
edges whose child is a leaf) and internal edges.
Where tree length is dominated by internal edges, variation between tips
is dominantly controlled by phylogenetic history.
