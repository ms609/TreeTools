\usage{
RoguePlot(
  trees,
  tip,
  p = 1,
  plot = TRUE,
  Palette = colorRampPalette(c(par("fg"), "#009E73"), space = "Lab"),
  nullCol = rgb(colorRamp(unlist(par(c("fg", "bg"))), space = "Lab")(0.8)/255),

}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{List or \code{multiPhylo} object containing phylogenetic trees
of class \code{phylo} to be summarized.}

\item{tip}{Numeric or character identifying rogue leaf, in format accepted
by \code{\link[=DropTip]{DropTip()}}.}

\item{p}{A numeric value between 0.5 and 1 giving the proportion for a clade
to be represented in the consensus tree (see \code{\link[=Consensus]{Consensus()}}).}

\item{plot}{Logical specifying whether to plot the tree.}

\item{Palette}{Function that takes a parameter \code{n} and generates a colour
palette with \code{n} entries.}

\item{nullCol}{Colour to paint regions of the tree on which the rogue is
never found.}

\item{edgeLength}{Numeric specifying edge lengths of consensus tree;
\code{NULL} aligns tips by scaling edges proportional to clade size; \code{1} sets
all edges to unit length.}

\item{thin, fat}{Numeric specifying width to plot edges if the rogue tip
never / sometimes does attach to them.}

\item{outgroupTips}{Vector of type character, integer or logical, specifying
the names or indices of the tips to include in the outgroup.  If
\code{outgroupTips} is a of type character, and a tree contains multiple tips
with a matching label, the first will be used.}

\item{\dots}{Additional parameters to \code{plot.phylo()}.}
}
\value{
\code{RoguePlot()} returns a list whose elements are:
\itemize{
\item \code{cons}: The reduced consensus tree, in preorder;
\item \code{onEdge}: a vector of integers specifying the number of
trees in \code{trees} in which the rogue leaf is attached to each edge in turn
of the consensus tree;
\item \code{atNode}: a vector of integers specifying the number of trees in \code{trees}
in which the rogue leaf is attached to an edge collapsed into each node
of the consensus tree.
}
}
\description{
Plots a consensus of trees with a rogue taxon omitted, with edges coloured
according to the proportion of trees in which the taxon attaches to that
edge, after Klopfstein & Spasojevic (2019).
