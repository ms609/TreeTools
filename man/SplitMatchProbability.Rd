\title{Probability of matching this well}
\usage{
SplitMatchProbability(split1, split2)

LnSplitMatchProbability(split1, split2)
}
\arguments{
\item{split1, split2}{Logical vectors listing terminals in same order, such that
each terminal is identified as a member of the ingroup (\code{TRUE}) or outgroup
(\code{FALSE}) of the respective bipartition split.}
}
\value{
The proportion of permissable informative splits
splitting the terminals into bipartitions of the sizes given,
that match as well as \code{split1} and \code{split2} do.
}
\description{
Calculates the probability that two random splits of the sizes provided
will be at least as similar as the two specified.
