#' TreeTools
#'
#' 'TreeTools' is an R package that provides functions for creating, modifying and
#' analysing phylogenetic trees.
#' It complements packages such as
#' ['ape'](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ape),
#' ['phangorn'](https://cran.r-project.org/package=phangorn) and
#' ['phytools'](https://cran.r-project.org/package=phytools),
#' aiming for efficient and robust implementations of functions, typically
#' applied to unweighted trees (i.e. those without edge lengths).
#'
#' Version 0.1 is a pre-release; some minor functionality may change in version
#' 1.0, due in mid-2020.
