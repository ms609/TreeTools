# Read posterior tree sample produced by MrBayes

Read posterior trees from
['MrBayes'](https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/) output files,
discarding burn-in generations.

## Usage

``` r
ReadMrBayesTrees(filepath, n = NULL, burninFrac = NULL)

ReadMrBayes(filepath, n = NULL, burninFrac = NULL)

MrBayesTrees(filepath, n = NULL, burninFrac = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- filepath:

  character string specifying path to `.nex` input file used to
  initialize the MrBayes analysis, relative to the R working directory
  (visible with [`getwd()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/getwd.html)).

- n:

  Integer specifying number of trees to sample from posterior.

- burninFrac:

  Fraction of trees to discard from each run as burn-in. If `NULL` (the
  default), this will be read from the last `mcmc` or `mcmcp` command in
  `filepath`.

## Value

`ReadMrBayesTrees()` returns a 'multiPhylo' object containing `n` trees
sampled evenly from all runs generated by analysis of `filepath`, or
`NULL` if no trees are found.

## Details

`ReadMrBayesTrees()` samples trees from the posterior distributions
computed using the Bayesian inference software
['MrBayes'](https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/)
